javac(compiler) compiles source code i.e high level which has extension .java

.class file is created after the compilation of .java(source code) which contains byte code

Java Virtual machine(JVM) executes the .class file i.e the bytecode by interpreting theme line by line using Jit

after interpreting bytecode JRE runs the java program

JVM is platform dependent i.e different devices would have different versions of JVM 

java is platform independent because java compiler creates a bytecode(.class file) instead of creating a binary code that has 0s and 1s. 

This bytecode(.class file) is platform independent as it can be executed on any device that has a JVM
